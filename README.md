# Learnings

I'm currently exploring various topics in computer science, cyber security and GUI customisation.

My main interests and curiosities at the moment are:

- Exploring Spicetify themes and extensions
- Developing cyber security fundamentals through Tryhackme
- Gaining foundational understanding of cryptography through Cryptohack

So far I have:
  - Launched an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance
  - Launched a Kali Linux instance in UTM
  - Enrolled in Cert IV in Cyber Security
  - Attended BSides conference
  - Gained memberships to Australian Women in Security Network and Women in Cyber Security
